## üîç Verification Steps

### Check Database
Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check all profiles
SELECT id, email, full_name, role, email_verified, created_at 
FROM profiles 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check user activities
SELECT user_id, activity_type, description, created_at 
FROM user_activities 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Expected Results
1. **Student**: Should have role="student", grade, country, state, school_name
2. **Teacher**: Should have role="teacher", basic info only
3. **Parent**: Should have role="parent", basic info only
4. **Activities**: Should show "account_created" activity for each user

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to create profile"
**Solution**: Check that the `profiles` table exists and has the correct structure

### Issue: "Passwords do not match"
**Solution**: Ensure both password fields are identical

### Issue: "Students must provide grade level and parent information"
**Solution**: Fill in all required fields for student registration

### Issue: "Please select your role"

## üìä Database Schema Verification

Ensure your `profiles` table has these columns:
