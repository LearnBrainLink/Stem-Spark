# Deployment Fix Guide

## Build Issues Resolved

The build was failing due to missing Supabase dependencies. Here's what was fixed:

### 1. Removed Problematic Dependencies
- Removed `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` which had missing dependencies
- Removed `@supabase/ssr` which was causing import issues
- Updated all API routes to use `@supabase/supabase-js` directly

### 2. Updated API Routes
All API routes now use the standard Supabase client:
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
)
```

### 3. Updated Client Components
Client components now use the browser client:
```typescript
import { createBrowserClient } from '@supabase/ssr'

const supabase = createBrowserClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
)
```

### 4. Environment Variables Required
Make sure these environment variables are set in your deployment:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 5. Build Commands
The build should now work with:
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

### 6. Authentication Flow
- Authentication is now handled at the component level
- Middleware provides basic route protection
- Each protected page handles its own auth logic

## Next Steps
1. Set up your Supabase project
2. Configure environment variables
3. Deploy to your preferred platform
4. Test all features

The application should now build and deploy successfully!
